# Todo-List
I build this todo list using html css js 
Add files via upload
In this project i learned about how to save data in localStorage and create multiple function 
1 saveTodo which is saved todo from localStorage if any
2. createTodoNode which is used for todo object and append it to the list
3. delBtn which is delete the button from list of todo
4. render it will render thw whole todo list from todo array
5. addTodo it push the new todo object
